I know these ideas need more refining but I had a tough time trying to come up with ideas. 


foodRecSys-V1

recipe reccomebder based on ingredients

food.com recipes and interactions
https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_recipes.csv
recipe reccomender based on reviews


Consumer Review of Amazon Products
https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products
maybe construct a reccomender based on reviews



A fourth idea could be something involving medal predictions for the Olympics. I know I saw a dataset for that during my hours of searching for inspiration.
